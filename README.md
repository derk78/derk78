## Hi there I'm Derek ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at my home high school, Evergreen High School while attending the computer science program at Warren tech. At the start of my tech journey it was pretty difficult especially with all the new things that I was learning so fast but I think that I have greatly improved since the start of my tech journey.

### My GoalsðŸŽ¯

- Develop a strong understanding of computer systems and coding
- Learn to communicate effectively and collaborate with others
- Gain hands on experience with networking, computer systems, and software devolpment

### Currently Working on

- Building my knowledge of Python, Networking, and Cybersecurity
- Creating interactive projects to gain more experience
- Increasing problem solving skills through hands-on projects and coding implementations

### Skills

- **Programming**: So far I have worked mainly with the Python programming language and feel my skills with it have greatly improved since I first started working with it at the start of this year.
- **Networking**: Have experience working with IP address, MAC addresses, and network scanning.
- **Projects**: Have made simple text based games, as well as working with and visualizing datasets using Pandas and Matplotlib.
